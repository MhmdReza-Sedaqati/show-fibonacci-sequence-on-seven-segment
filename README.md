We want to design an application as follows:


	Obtaining the first 20 terms of the Fibonacci sequence.
	
	Display the first sentence of this sequence on the seven segment.
	
	The presence of a push-button so that, as soon as it is pressed, the next term of the Fibonacci sequence is calculated and shown on the seven segment.
	
	Since the 20th term of this sequence is 4 digits, maximum 4 displays are enough for this application.
